2. Install Python Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Update Configuration File
Rename trial_config.yaml to init_config_LDBG_L31_ID2.yaml (or update the path in class_Settings.py)

4. Run the Trial
bash
python sensaray.py
🎯 What the Trial Does
✅ Processes test images instead of live camera feeds
✅ Simulates thermal data with configurable temperature
✅ Runs contamination detection on sample images
✅ Shows real-time display of processing results
✅ Logs all activities for review
✅ Creates output files in the data directory
✅ Tests HSV processing with sample contamination

📊 Trial Outputs
After running, you'll see:

Console output with processing statistics
Log files in logs/ directory
Processed images in data/upload/
Live display window showing detection results
🔧 Customizing the Trial
You can modify trial_config.yaml to:

Adjust detection thresholds
Change processing parameters
Modify loop duration
Enable/disable features
🏭 Upgrading to Production
To use with real hardware:

Install Arena SDK for cameras
Connect thermal sensors
Change sensaray_type from 'TRIAL_MODE' to your actual system type
Update camera parameters in config
Set trial_mode: false
🐛 Troubleshooting
Issue: "Configuration file not found"

Make sure trial_config.yaml is renamed to init_config_LDBG_L31_ID2.yaml
Or update the CONFIG_FILE path in class_Settings.py
Issue: "No test images available"

The trial will auto-create sample images in data/test_images/
You can add your own images to this directory
Issue: OpenCV display not working

Make sure you have a display environment (not running headless)
Set show_pics: false in config to disable display
📝 Key Configuration Options
yaml
# Essential trial settings
sensaray_type: 'TRIAL_MODE'     # Enables trial mode
trial_mode: true                # Additional trial features
looptime: 300                   # Run duration (seconds)
show_pics: true                 # Enable/disable display
hsv_pixel_threshold: 20         # Contamination sensitivity
🔄 Next Steps
Run the trial to familiarize yourself with the system
Experiment with different threshold values
Add your own test images
Review the log files to understand the processing flow
When ready, configure for your production hardware
